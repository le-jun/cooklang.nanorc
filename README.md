# Cooklang Nano syntax highlight file for GNU nano text editor
Quick and dirty nanorc file for [Cooklang](https://github.com/cooklang/spec) support on [GNU nano text editor](https://www.nano-editor.org/). 
## Installation
1. Copy the file 
2. Put it in the `~/.nano/` directory
3. Add it to nano included files by adding `include ~/.nano/cooklang.nanorc` to `~/.nanorc` (User specific) or `/etc/nanorc` (System wide).
## Note
Note that being a total regexp beginner, I just couldnâ€™t make it support single elements without using brackets. Feel free to fork, pull-request, dm or pigeon post me a solution.
